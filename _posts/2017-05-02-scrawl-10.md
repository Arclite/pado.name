title: Scrawl 1.0

Last Monday saw the release of my first independent app in over five years. [Scrawl](https://appsto.re/us/4PGrjb.i) is an extremely simple app to store quick, temporary notes. These are notes that you don't want to keep around forever, and which probably won't even make sense shortly after they're written—parking spots, pizza orders, one-off phone numbers, etc.

Scrawl was written over a weekend after a frustrating experience with airport customs and baggage claims. The 1.0 is extremely barebones; it's simply a text box and a widget that can display text outside the app context.

I've got some ideas on how to make the Scrawl experience a little nicer (special handling for certain data types, automation, etc.), but by its very nature, Scrawl will always be a very basic app. As such, it is available **completely free of charge**; it doesn't even display ads.

Check out [Scrawl on the App Store](https://appsto.re/us/4PGrjb.i) today. If you like it, please leave a review.

**P.S.** Scrawl isn't the only new app I have in the pipeline. I'm hoping to release a slightly more-ambitious app before this year's WWDC. If you're interested in beta testing that app, e-mail me at pado@cocoatype.com.

**P.P.S.** If you've been wondering why there hasn't been any communication about WWDC Parties 2017, now you know. 🙂
