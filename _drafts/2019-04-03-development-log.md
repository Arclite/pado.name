In this session, I brought some of the 1.x Black Highlighter design into the new app. I also improved an aspect of the app that was lacking in the original version: support for Dynamic Type.

Getting into the meat of the development, I built out the app's intro view controller, which prompts users for access to their photo library. I created a few component classes, laid out the first view, and hooked up the photo permission request. Currently, the result of the request is just logged to the console.
