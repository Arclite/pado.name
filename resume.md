I'm a highly-experienced mobile developer with a focus on iOS applications.

### Software Engineer III @ Chewy <span class="duration">May 2022 &ndash; Today</span>

At Chewy, I worked across teams to improve standards for all iOS developers at Chewy. I introduced the team to concepts like modularization, dependency injection, etc. I created tools that helped developers identify untested code, leading to a 5% overall increase in code coverage over the next six months. I led the team that built our design system, providing shared UI components to the teams building individual features.

I also did 1-on-1 mentoring with several junior devs and senior Android devs looking to improve their iOS knowledge. I met with these devs multiple times a week, helping them with projects and coaching them on engineering best practices.

### Software Engineer III @ Rover <span class="duration">June 2018 &ndash; April 2022</span>

At Rover, I worked on the developer platform, focused primarily on mobile. My role was to improve the developer experience for Rover&apos;s other mobile developers. I cut our iOS test run times from almost two hours to just under 30 minutes. I also helped build and define components for our design system, to help make the Rover app a more consistent experience for both developers and users.

A major project I took on was improving our mobile release process. When I joined, releases took a whole day to perform, which made releases rare and unpredictable. Under my leadership, releases became mostly automated, and performed on a regular two-week cadence. 

### Senior Software Engineer @ L4 Digital <span class="duration">March 2015 &ndash; June 2018</span>

At L4 Digital, I worked on mobile projects for clients, communicating closely with them and all members of our delivery team. For one large project which spanned ten months and five developers, I was technical lead, in charge of making development design decisions.

I was also platform lead for the iOS platform, keeping other developers updated on current projects, teaching new techniques, and leading discussion of news in the iOS community. I drafted L4's first coding standards for Swift and maintained them through major changes to the language.

### Director of App Development @ Newsy <span class="duration"> May 2011 &ndash; May 2014</span>

At Newsy, I was responsible for either building or managing development of apps on approximately 10 mobile and OTT platforms. I was the lead developer on our apps for iPhone, iPad, and Windows. I managed external vendors who built the others, including defining the API that all apps used.

I also worked closely with newsroom staff, which resulted in the creation of two in-house apps that improved the efficiency (and happiness!) of writers and anchors.

### Other Experience

I'm a host for the Xcoders iOS developer meetup in Redmond, WA, where I've given long-form talks on continuous integration and accessibility, and several short "lightning" talks on other topics.

On the side, I develop my own personal apps; I currently have five apps in the App Store. I live-stream my work on these apps on Twitch, interacting with others who are interested in mobile development.

### Skills

Expert in both Objective-C and Swift. Comfortable with frameworks and design paradigms for all Apple platforms (including macOS!). Experience with Docker for server deployment. Familiar with development in React Native. Other known languages include Ruby, Clojure, TypeScript, and Kotlin.
