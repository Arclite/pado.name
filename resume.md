I'm a passionate mobile developer with over 15 years of experience building for Apple platforms. I work with teams of all sizes and skills to create and maintain high-quality, user-centric apps.

### Software Engineer III @ Chewy <span class="duration">May 2022 &ndash; Today</span>

- Led the team that built Chewy's design system on iOS and Android, working directly with design partners to provide shared UI components to feature teams.
- Performed regular 1-on-1 mentoring with several junior devs and senior Android devs looking to improve their iOS knowledge.
- Introduced the entire iOS development team to modern app architecture concepts such as modularization, dependency injection, etc.
- Created and deployed tools that helped developers identify untested code, leading to a 20% overall increase in code coverage.

### Software Engineer III @ Rover <span class="duration">June 2018 &ndash; April 2022</span>

- Formed and led several "tiger teams" focused on short-term, high-priority, high-impact projects, including coordinating resources with cross-team management.
- Advocated for and implemented restructuring of mobile release process, drastically cutting time to release and resulting in a regular, stable release cadence.
- Defined and built design system components, creating a consistent experience for both developers and users.
- Cut iOS test run times from almost two hours to just under 30 minutes.

### Senior Software Engineer @ L4 Digital <span class="duration">March 2015 &ndash; June 2018</span>

- Developed mobile projects for clients, communicating closely with product owners and our delivery team. 
- Technical lead for a particularly large project which spanned ten months and five developers.
- As platform lead for the iOS platform, responsible for keeping other developers updated on current projects, teaching new techniques, and leading discussion of news in the iOS community.
- Drafted L4's first coding standards for Swift and maintained them through major changes to the language.

### Director of App Development @ Newsy <span class="duration"> May 2011 &ndash; May 2014</span>

- Lead developer on Newsy apps for iPhone, iPad, and Windows.
- Managed vendors who built apps for 7 other mobile and OTT platforms; defined the API used by all apps.
- Worked closely with newsroom staff, resulting in the creation of two in-house apps that improved the efficiency (and happiness!) of writers and anchors.

### Other Experience

- Former host for the Xcoders iOS developer meetup in Redmond, WA, where I gave long-form talks on continuous integration and accessibility, and several short "lightning" talks on other topics.
- Develop my own personal apps, including five apps currently in the App Store.
- Live-stream work on my personal apps on Twitch and YouTube, interacting with and educating others who are interested in mobile development.

### Skills

- Expert in both Objective-C and Swift. Comfortable with frameworks and design paradigms for all Apple platforms (including macOS and visionOS).
- Experience with Docker for server deployment.
- Other known languages include Ruby, Clojure, TypeScript, and Kotlin.
- Familiar with cross-platform development in React Native.
