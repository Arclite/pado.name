## Profile

I'm a software developer who specializes in the creation of mobile applications. I've been building iOS apps since the App Store launched in 2008, and have since shipped apps for both the Android and Windows Phone platforms as well.

## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer @ L4 Digital <span class="duration">March 2015 &ndash; Present</span>

At L4 Digital, I work in small teams to deliver mobile applications for our clients. I have been the technical lead for two major projects, and have worked on small parts of several others.

I provide in-house technical leadership for the iOS platform. This includes several aspects, including running a monthly meeting to discuss the latest best practices for iOS developers. I also drafted the first version of L4's coding standards for the Swift language.

### Director of App Development @ Newsy <span class="duration"> May 2011 &ndash; May 2014</span>

At Newsy, I was responsible for the development of video news applications for mobile platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. I also built several in-house apps to improve the workflow of coworkers in other departments.

As director, I worked directly with other department directors at Newsy to coordinate efforts throughout the development process. During my tenure, Newsy shipped several new applications, many major updates, and prototypes for entirely new product lines.

### Founder/Developer @ Cocoatype, LLC <span class="duration">2008 &ndash; March 2015</span>

In 2008, I founded Cocoatype to build consumer software applications. Doing so, I became very familiar with developing for both Mac OS X and iOS. I worked directly with top-notch designers, helping me learn how to make an app that works for users.

Beginning in 2014, Cocoatype did mobile and web application contracting. I was responsible for everything from working with clients to determine requirements to delivering the final product.

## Skills

I have significant experience with iOS application development in both Swift and Obj-C. I'm also quite familiar with server-side development in Ruby and Clojure.

I also have strong interpersonal skills. For most of my career, I've worked closely with people from other disciplines. I'm able to communicate technical details to non-technical people in order to reach an understanding.
