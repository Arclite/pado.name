In this first session, I introduced the Black Highlighter app, went over my goals for this series, and the major update I'll be working on.

Getting into the meat of the development, I built out the app's intro view controller, which prompts users for access to their photo library. I created a few component classes, laid out the first view, and hooked up the photo permission request. Currently, the result of the request is just logged to the console.
